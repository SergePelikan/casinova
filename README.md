## Which casinos will be among the largest in the world in 2021?

Most casino licenses are issued by Malta and Gibraltar, which is why many of the major operators are based here. A few years ago, William Hill was number one. The former bookmaker from Great Britain has matured at a rapid pace to become a top provider whose casino still offers the best sports betting. In the meantime, some competitors have not only caught up, but also overtaken the group.

## What are the advantages of an online casino?

Online gambling is trendy and is making local casinos more and more competitive. Why should you go to the casino when you can get big money comfortably from home? To be a millionaire in sweatpants - virtual gambling makes it possible! But there are other reasons why it is worth playing online.

### Online Casino Bonus

A casino bonus is generally used when a certain promotion is offered. These promotions are usually limited in time and can change several times a year with a single provider. It is therefore advisable to keep an eye on the offers on a regular basis.

### Free spins and bonus funds

Of course there is the possibility to play casino games for free. There are more and more providers on the market who offer games as free versions . Often it is not even necessary to register in order to try out the various classics and slot machines . The playing conditions are the same as in real money mode, but you are playing for no real money and the winnings are only virtual . So if you want the winnings to be paid out, you must of course also deposit.

Online casinos also give away bonus credits , which at times also give you the option of gaming without making a deposit. However, when comparing the providers, pay attention to the amount of the fees, because some companies withhold a certain part of the profit.


## Online casino reviews: Stiftung Warentest financial test

When gambling becomes an addiction, there is often a risk of financial decline while one hopes for the big win. Reputable casinos offer protection for gambling addicts. Players can have a lock set up against themselves at the casinos. The casino financial test from Stiftung Warentest explains which rules must be observed when gambling in casinos as well as online.

Stiftung Warentest has found two hooks when it comes to player bans in stationary casinos. On the one hand, the form for this is only available in the casino. The casino and the player conclude a contract according to which the player should not be allowed to play. On the other hand, the casino does not have to ensure compliance with the game ban by means of a control at the entrance or a video control. A clear indication at the entrance that no gaming contract will be concluded is sufficient. As the casino is not committed to looking after the players' financial interests. If the player goes to the casino anyway, the contract stipulates that his winnings will not be paid out and his losses will not be reimbursed. This should act as a deterrent to banned players.
